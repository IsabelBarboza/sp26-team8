## About Me
Hi, my name is Isabel. I’m from Peru and I love playing video games. I studied Cybersecurity at my previous college, and now I’m really excited to be at UNCG. I’m motivated to learn more about software development. 

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to get a good understanding of GitHub, improve my coding skills, and enjoy learning while working on our class project. I’m excited to learn, practice, and grow throughout this class.
